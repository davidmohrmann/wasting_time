# Wasting Time

The purpose of this assignment was to use the U.S. Departments of Labor's data on Americans' time use for research and analysis.

The primary goal was to compare different populations and answer macro and micro level questions on the different ways people from different demographics spent their time during a typical day.

After completing this assignment, one will be versed in understanding how to use public data for analysis; understand how to translate data from CSVs into pandas Dataframes; use pandas to parse and analyze data; clean the data; and chart the data.

The data used for this assignment comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which publishes yearly data about how Americans spend their time. Using this data, there are certain insights that can be gleaned and used to make wide generalizations of the public's use of their time.
